// Kartik Bhaiya and Kanak Bhaiya are discussing a special type of 
// number, which they call a Coding Blocks Number (CB Number). 
// A number qualifies as a CB Number based on the following criteria:

// 0 and 1 are not considered CB numbers.
// The following prime numbers are always CB numbers:
// 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.
// Any other number is a CB number if it is not divisible by any 
// of the numbers listed in point (2).

// The Challenge
// Kartik Bhaiya challenges Kanak Bhaiya with a problem:
// He provides a string of digits, and Kanak Bhaiya must determine
//  the maximum number of CB numbers that can be extracted from it 
// while following these constraints:

// 1. Non-overlapping Substrings:
// A CB number cannot be a substring or superstring of another chosen 
// CB number.
// Example: In 4991, both 499 and 991 are CB numbers, but we can choose
// only one of them.

// 2. Valid Substring Selection:
// The CB number must be a contiguous substring of the given string.
// Example: In 481, we cannot select 41 as a CB number because 41 is
//  not a contiguous substring of "481."

// 3. Maximization Goal:
// Since multiple solutions may exist, the goal is to find the 
// maximum number of CB numbers that can be extracted from the given 
// string.
// Kanak Bhaiya has a class of Launchpad students to teach and needs
// help solving this challenge. Assist him in finding the solution.


// Input Format
// First line contain size of the string.
// Next line is A string of digits.

// Constraints
// 1 <= Length of strings of digits <= 17

// Output Format
// Maximum number of CB numbers that can be formed.

// Sample Input
// 5
// 81615

// Sample Output
// 2

// Explanation
// For the string "81615"

// Digits	Possible Substrings
// 1-digit	8, 1, 6, 1, 5
// 2-digit	81, 16, 61, 15
// 3-digit	816, 161, 615
// 4-digit	8161, 1615
// 5-digit	81615

// Step 2: Identifying Valid CB Numbers

// We check each substring against CB number conditions:

// CB Numbers Found: 5, 61, 161
// Not CB Numbers: 8, 1, 6, 15, 81, 816, 615, 8161, 1615, 81615
// Numbers like 8, 6, and 81 are invalid as they are divisible by 2 or 3.
// 161 and 61 are valid as they are not divisible by any CB prime.
// Final Answer:

// The maximum number of CB numbers extracted from "81615" is: 2
